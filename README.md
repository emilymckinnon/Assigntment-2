Domain Name Servers (DNS) works like a digital phone book but instead of looking up a name and getting a phone number, your ISP (Internet Server Provider) takes a domain name and looks up (or assigns)  the IP (Internet Protocol) number (or address). 
The IP is an numerical address (###.###.###.###) that serves  two functions,1. host or network identification 2. location addressing. These IPs are used similarly to how you address an envelope. Your personal IP from your computer would be the return while the domain IP you want to reach would be the recipient.
When you send an email (electronic mail) the DNS servers accepts, forwards, delivers, and stores the message using both sender and IP addresses.
